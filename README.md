# json-formatter
The only JSON code formatter / Prettifier you will ever need! 

# How to use
1. open the 'bad.json' and paste your json there
2. open the folder in cmd or powershell and enter `python json_formatter.py` to start the process ( nothing will be prompted )
3. the 'good.json' file will be created in the same directory


( use `python3` command instead of `python` if you are using linux or mac os )
